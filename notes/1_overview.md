## Reactive Data Binding

### Data driven view
+ By only manipulating data, DOM will be updated
+ No more dealing with Data, just deal with the **state** so called ``database`` in frontend

### Directive
+ Things like ``v-if`` and ``v-for`` allow you to bind DOM structure to data
+ You can add transition effect when inserting or removing data

## Component System
+ Props in events out... better for management
+ Vue component is similar to Web Components Spec
+ It can be nested inside a native custom element
+ It provides cross-component data flow (Vuex?)
+ It provides custom event communication
+ You can do dynamic component switching with transition effects
